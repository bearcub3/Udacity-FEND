# Restaurant Reviews App
---

## Project Overview

For the **Restaurant Reviews** projects, I will incrementally convert a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. I will take a static design that lacks accessibility and convert the design to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. I will also add a service worker to begin the process of creating a seamless offline experience for your users.

### Run the application

1. Download the zip file or clone this project `$git clone https://github.com/bearcub3/Udacity-FEND.git` to run this project locally. In this folder, find the restaurant review app and start up a simple HTTP server.

    * In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
   * Note -  For Windows systems, Python 3.x is installed as `python` by default. To start a Python 3.x server, you can simply enter `python -m http.server 8000`.
2. With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`, and look around for a bit to see what the current experience looks like.
3. Explore the provided code, and start making a plan to implement the required features in three areas: responsive design, accessibility and offline use.
4. Write code to implement the updates to get this site on its way to being a mobile-ready website.
