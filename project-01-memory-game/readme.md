# Udacity FEND Project 02

## [Memory Game](https://bearcub3.github.io/Udacity-FEND/project-01-memory-game/index.html)
Users win once they find all the matching pairs of the cards which are randomly shuffled before the game. I made this game with a little twist. In the beginning, users are able to see all the cards for about 4 seconds. then, all the cards flip over. and the users can start flipping cards to find all the matching ones. Since users can breifly see all of the cards, the criteria for acheiving 3 stars is stricter. Once users complete a game, they can save their score (the number of flips/the time taken) with their name (although any words can be written) and compete with other people. Only the top three scores will be shown on the leaderboard. If scores are tied for the number of flip moves, the person who finishes the game in the least time will take first place. To save names, please use the 'Enter' key. For better UX, I will progressively update the usability with a different or various event handler(s).  

### Project Goals
1. responsive design for different devices(mainly based on iOS)
2. implementing all the game behavior requirements
3. creating a leaderboard using local storage

### Dependencies
1. HTML5
2. CSS3
3. Vanilla JS
4. NPM Node-SASS
5. Bootstrap such as Font Awesome


### Sources
1. Personally, the trickiest part of this project was to create the shuffling function. So, I included [the link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2450954/how-to-randomize-shuffle-a-javascript-array?page=2&tab=votes#tab-top) as a part of the reference. There were many methods such as applying the Fisher-Yates Shuffle or the Richard Durstenfeld method. I referred to the one which personally I felt was more explicit than the others.

2. CSS card animation effects such as pop and skew are originally from [Iain Lunn's Hover Effect](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/#licenses).

3. I used [Google Web Fonts API](https://fonts.google.com/) for the fonts in the game. 


### Bugs
If you find any Bugs, Please let me know. or you can become a contributor as well!

### Conclusion
I think this is a good project for JavaScript Beginners and Intermediates who are striving to take a further step into in-depth JS. I really enjoyed the time I spent writing my own code; even the time I spent researching to find a solution when I was stuck, and eventually saw what I had created on my own with my own eyes. It really boosts my confidence in JS and I loved the whole process!
