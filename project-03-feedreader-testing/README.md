# Udacity FEND Project 04

## [Feed Reader Testing](https://www.udacity.com/course/javascript-testing--ud549)

I have learned about Unit Testing, Test Driven Development(TDD) using Jasmine from this course. and I believe this project is a good small example of how to implement them.


## Project Goals

Writing spec file that Jasmine will read and run all the tests against the application and passing all the specs.
