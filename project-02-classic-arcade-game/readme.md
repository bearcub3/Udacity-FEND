# Udacity FEND Project 03

## [Aracade Game](https://bearcub3.github.io/Udacity-FEND/project-02-classic-arcade-game/index.html)

To start this game, choose your character and then press the 'Enter' key to activate the game.
A player can either aim to earn the highest points to win a game or just Enjoy the game!
For more details, the initially given time for a game is only 40 seconds. However, a game can be extended for 10 seconds by catching a star item. A new star appears almost every 6 seconds once one has been collected by a player.
There is also a heart item which gives an extra life to a user. The user should try to collect  star and heart items to maximize his/her chance to earn the highest points. Basically, the longer a user plays the game, the more points they can collect!! 
The points given to the gems vary by their colors. 
At the end of the game, the user can see the result of their game. For example, how long a player played the game and how many points he/she got. I once won over 300 points! So, the high scores are possible!
